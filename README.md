### Project title
O-zone (Omnizone) &nbsp;--&nbsp; a cross-platform social media aggregation and management

&nbsp;

### What and why?
Our project is a web application that essentially an aggregation of social media platforms. It will gather information on different social media and present it to the users. It will also provide users opportunity to build or join online communities on our platform. 

It is trivial to switch across different platforms and then search on certain topics or KOLs through complicated operations on the application interface. This triviality fatigues people and also is a waste of time. 

Our project will solve this problem by gathering ideally all the information the users would like to know about their favorite topics and KOLs and presenting it in a proper way, saving users plenty of time on switching among platforms and doing the searches manually. 

&nbsp;

### For whom?
Our project is designed for people who are: 
type 1: individuals supposedly active on social media and own accounts across various platforms (reddit, facebook, twitter, etc.). 
type 2: business corporations or agencies that need to gather information from or push posts to various platforms. 

Typicality of our users: having a lots of personal interests or hobbies, following certain types of KOLs or idols, being fanatic fans of KOLs or idols, participating the discussion on forums, and so on. 

&nbsp;

### How?
1. The App is a social media platform aggregation. It can save userâ€™s accounts of different social media apps like Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram, and bring together all the contents that you subscribed to on different social media platforms in only one App. 
   
2. If you search for a celebrity, you will see all his posts on the different social media platforms. 
   
3. The App aggregates people who have the same interest. You can create a community of a specific topic or a celebrity so that you can interact with people who have the same interest as you. In the community, you can post and comment on the topic of the community.
   
4. Based on your interest, it will recommend to you posts and channels that you did not subscribe to before.
   
5. The App shows the trend of what is searched most in the App. In every community, there is also a trend of what is searched most within this community.
   
6. You will be able to push your post on the App, without the necessity of switching among different platforms. 

7. You can see the relationship between you and others. If two users often search the same topic, have the same follows and followings, and often visit the same community, they will have a higher relationship score. 
   
&nbsp;

### Scope
The work needs to be done include but not limited to: 
1. UI design
2. Database access
3. API access to various social media platforms
4. Algorithm involved in the trend and relationship score calculation
5. Implementation of our own API
6. QA, QC, and Testing
7. Addition of new features; changes of plan due to unrealizable features

The work listed above is believed to be adequate for a plenary semester of our software development team. API and the algorithm mentioned above are assumed to be difficult and time-consuming.
